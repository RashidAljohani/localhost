A friend of mine asked me on another day .. how he could help his customers to modify API Connect configuration to support an especial case that was raised by the security team. API Connect uses DataPower as API Gateway to support securing and managing the APIs traffic. Part of that is allowing end-users to define their own policies besides the [built-in](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/10.0.5.x_lts?topic=constructs-built-in-policies) ones. 

In the following steps, you will learn how to define a global security policy that removes a particular key from the message's headers as a post-response policy for a gateway service.


* Define the policy logic, and save it to `remove-x-client-ip.yaml`

```yaml
global-policy: 1.0.0
info:
  name: remove-x-client-ip
  title: remove-x-client-ip
  version: 1.0.0
gateways:
  - datapower-api-gateway
assembly:
  execute:
      - set-variable:
          version: 2.0.0
          title: Remove X-Client-IP
          actions:
            - clear: message.headers.X-Client-IP
```

You will notice that I've used one of the built-in policy that DataPower provide: [set-variable](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/10.0.5.x_lts?topic=policies-set-variable) to clearn a key from the message's headers.


* Login to API Manager:

```bash
$ apic login --server <apim-endpoint>
```

* Create a global policy:

```
$ apic global-policies:create --catalog sandbox --configured-gateway-service <api-gateway-service-name> --org <porg-name> --server <apim-endpoint> --scope catalog remove-x-client-ip.yaml
```

* List global policies to validate:

```
$ apic global-policies:list-all --catalog sandbox --configured-gateway-service <api-gateway-service-name> --org <porg-name> --server <apim-endpoint> --scope catalog
```

* Write the URL of the required global policy to a `.yaml` file:

```
$ apic global-policies:get --catalog sandbox --configured-gateway-service <api-gateway-service-name> --org <porg-name>--server <apim-endpoint> --scope catalog remove-x-client-ip:1.0.0 --fields url
```

* Edit the GlobalPolicy.yaml file and replace the string `url` with `global_policy_url`. The resulting file has the following format:

```
global_policy_url: >-
  https://server_host_name/api/catalogs/catalog_id/configured-gateway-services/gateway_service_id/global-policies/policy_id
```

* In this case, we want to designate the global policy to be the [post-response](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/10.0.5.x_lts?topic=applications-working-global-policies) policy:

```bash
$ apic global-policy-posthooks:create --catalog sandbox --configured-gateway-service <api-gateway-service-name> --org <porg-name> --server <apim-endpoint> --scope catalog GlobalPolicy.yaml
```


* Test your APIs to validate the policy

```yaml
